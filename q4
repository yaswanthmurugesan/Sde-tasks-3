.Print the result of using concat on the two arrays. Does concat alter the original arrays? Verify this by printing holdCabinet1 after using the method.
 console.log(holdCabinet1.concat(holdCabinet2));
 console.log(holdCabinet1);

b.Print a slice of two elements from each array. Does slice alter the original

c.reverse the first array, and sort the second. What is the difference between these two methods? Do the methods alter the original arrays?

 holdCabinet2.sort();
 console.log(holdCabinet1);
 console.log(holdCabinet2);
