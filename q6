a.	Define and initialize the following arrays, which hold the name, chemical symbol and mass for different elements:
 i.	element1 = ['hydrogen', 'H', 1.008]
 ii.	element2 = ['helium', 'He', 4.003]
 iii.	element26 = ['iron', 'Fe', 55.85]

 let element1 = ['hydrogen', 'H', 1.008];
 let element2 = ['helium', 'He', 4.003];
 let element26 = ['iron', 'Fe', 55.85];

b.Define the array table, and use push(arrayName) to add each of the element
 arrays to it. Print table to see its structure.
 
c.Use bracket notation to examine the difference between printing table[1] and table[1][1]. 
Dont just nod your head! I want to HEAR you describe this difference.
Go ahead, talk to your screen.

console.log(table[1], table[1][1]);

d.Using bracket notation and the table array, print the mass of element1, the
 name for element 2 and the symbol for element26
